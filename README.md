Lastpass to Aegis Conversion Utility
===

To run this, download the script and run:
`python lp_aegis/convert.py path/to/lastpass_auth_export.json`

It will convert the LastPass Authenticator entries to the Aegis JSON format. Then, go to Import/Export -> Import in Aegis and use the Aegis file type.

You will need to transfer the files off and back onto your phone to make this work, something like Dropbox will make that easy.
